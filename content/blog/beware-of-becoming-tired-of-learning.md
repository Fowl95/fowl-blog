It is incredibly easy to loathe learning.

The chief pitfall is getting stuck in **product mode**; this being the focus on *doing* to carry out a task until you it the "Done" attitude. It may appear in form of statistics - just think of the 0 flashcards queue in a SRS. You crave for the metrics' approval, because you have been taught that they are always right, that grades will define you. 

I myself am not free of this sin. I might actually be one of the foremost sin-bearers in this regard. I need to get the sweet *completion* feeling that will allow me to rest and be at peace.

Product is not-so-often you used with a negative meaning, since in the start-up world and productivity addicts *product is king.* Get a good product and all your wrongdoings will be exculpated. 

However, I have a different story to tell and I will do so through a very simple example.

## Optimization

What a beautiful word to utter in an office to get a promotion. What could be better than *optimizing something*?

Imagine playing a video game and training for hours on end to get better. You read guides, you *optimize* your build, because the person at the top is using that build and, therefore, if you want to be successful you must dress as he does, swing the word the same way and learn exactly the same skills. 

I am not in any mood to drag this metaphor further than this. You should be able to see how joy-sapping that would be, shouldn't you? Optimizing a *game* that you are supposed to enjoy, just because it helps you feel better, like you are doing the right thing. Never mind it is a videogame you are playing, not a Google internship. Never mind you should feel at peace with yourself as priority number one. 

During our school years, we are told to optimize our time, to follow the homework relentlessly or we will be punished - please do not take this as endorsement for the *school is slavery* movement, I do not agree with them nor do I want to express my support for them. What I am saying is that there is a large margin to improve the schooling experience, not that I want to destroy the system. 

Back on track. School is the first place where we tried to optimize our life, judging our progression and failings with marks. Fun fact: school is not optimized. School is the most inefficient system after your small town's political scene. 

## Worship a Product

We are subtly told that grades are who we are, that the metrics are the end, the product we ought to relentlessly pursue. 

Well, there are metrics that are really important in life. No one should mistake my article as a "aha! I will beat the system by committing to sloth." The problem is that we are mostly faced with vanity metrics in school. 

Sleep, depth of exploration, enjoyment while solving a problem. There are things we should bait into our lives and they *should* be our aim. For an aimless life is worse than spending your entire existence in high school. 

The product approach steers us towards *rate of* *completion*, *grades.*
