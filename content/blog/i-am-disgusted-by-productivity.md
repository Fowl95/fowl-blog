It is extremely difficult to say "productivity" in a conversation without spouting an incredible burst of survivor-biases and wrong opinions.

Until recently, I thought that music was way better than no music, for example. Well, I have documented the incredible difference it actually makes to write without any sound at all. Silence has this calming effect and visibly enhanced my output in writing, learning and working. 

Relaxing with some music is not a capital sin, obviously. If I am simply designing something or doing some menial job, music is great; even better, sometimes I can multi-task while listening to podcasts or audiobooks. 

People just recoiled from my last sentence:

*"Oh my God, I would never be able to do that!"*

May be. Or maybe you never *tried*. Lots of people want to get into something and then they go crazy over the first hurdle. 

If you listen to podcasts while doing something else, you will **obviously** lose some parts here and there. So what? **Embrace the forgetting, embrace the imperfection.** 

Take-aways for dumber people who did not get the subtext:

1. Opinions are not facts. Experience is not a fact. Preferences are even farther from facts.

2. A relaxed disposition is essential to grasp the core of this article. And it is the core of this article.

*I will try my best at being both consistent with facts and draw from my experience for narrative reasons.*

# Multi-Tasking 

If you ask anyone on the streets, one of the most enticing hallmarks of productivity is **multi-tasking.** 

> Another difficulty I have is to jungle with several mind consuming tasks in a single day. If I focus on writing a paper it's very difficult to work on a coding project. Or if I work on a coding project, it's very difficult to work on configuring \[...] I have this tendency for being "all consumed" by whatever I do

Those are the words of dear friend of mine struggling to keep up with multiple things at once. 

Keep in mind that piece, we will get back to it soon. But first, we are going to define what multi-tasking  is.

***Task switching, not multi-tasking.** The term multi-tasking is actually a misnomer. People can't actually do more than one task at a time. Instead we switch tasks. So the term that is used in the research is "task switching". - [Jessica Sneider](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201209/the-true-cost-multi-tasking), Psichology Today*

When task-switching is being evaluated, we have to consider two different time dimensions:

1. Contemporarily task-switching, when you try to do two things almost at the same time. e.g. Chatting on Discord while working. 

2. Sequentially task-switching, when you tackle major projects in turns. e.g. Working on a research paper for thirty minutes and building a web app for thirty minutes after.

Let me give you a break-down of my activities in a day, in order of time spent on each:

Learning, it probably takes two to four hours each day.

You can further break it down in: 

\- Repetitions

\- Incremental Reading 

\- University
